Smart Queuing System using OpenVINO /Choosing the Right Hardware

## Main Tasks
The following pages will walk you through the steps of the project. At a high level, you will:

### Propose a possible hardware solution
Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
Revise your proposal based on the test results

### The Scenarios
We've provided three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

The three scenarios you'll be looking at are:

* Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
* Scenario 2: Retail Sector
* Scenario 3: Transportation Sector
If you look at the pages immediately after this one, you'll see that there's one page for each of these scenarios.

### Hardware Proposal
All of the scenarios involve people in queues, but each scenario will require different hardware. So your first task will be to determine which hardware might work for each scenarioâ€”and then explain your initial choice in a proposal document (see below).

Later, after you've built and tested your application on each hardware device for all three scenarios, you'll review the results and validate or update your initial proposed choices in the proposal document.
